# Description:
#  ChangeLog file for package xtcav
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package author: Alvaro Sanchez-Gonzalez

Please describe any modifications that you made to the package in the
reverse time order.

-Small typo in comment, and small error in the autorheshold algorithm, which probably did not have any consequences, except for making it a bit slower, but that could have them in certain scenarios.

Add workaround for problem that returned incorrect epics information
on shots where XTCAV was not recorded.  This happened because we
are using indexing-mode, and xtcav is not recording epics data on
shots where the camera is not recorded, coupled with the incorrect
idea of a global "Env" where epics information is stored (vs.
stored "per-shot").  The workaround is to check for an xtcav image
before trying to access the epics variables when analyzing lasing-off.

Add timestamp of one of the lasing-off shots into the lasing-off constants, so that
shot can be viewed later by jumping to it.

From Alvaro Sanchez-Gonzalez	


-The full results structure now also returns the power obtained from the RMS and COM method without gas detector normalization.
-Greatly improved performance by optimizing some of the calculations performed for the autothreshold and the scipylabel algorithms. This was originally causing some jobs to swap memory too often making them really slow.

Fix crash when image was almost empty, so "physical units" PU['xfs']
in Utils.py only had len(1).  Now mark those images as failed.

From Alvaro Sanchez-Gonzalez	
-Small bug corrected that was leading to bad behavior when the user tried to load a lasing off reference with the old variable names.
-Added Test.py for running standard tests using python Tests.py on the main three classes. These tests are not exhaustive (they are not sophisticated unit tests of anything like that), as they do not test all possible combinations of paramentes, but at least they allow for a quick check. They require access to experiment 'amo86815'.
-Add method InterBunchPulseDelayBasedOnCurrentMultiple.
-Added docstring to IslandSplittingContour.
-Attribute islandSplitMethod renamed to islandsplitmethod to keep consistency.
-Changed names of the parameters for the island split method: par1 and par2 to islandsplitpar1, islandsplitpar2, so at least the name states that they refer to the island splitting process (even if they are used differently by different algorithms at some point).
-Added an option to methods which depends on the reconstruction algorithm (RMS or COM) to select which algorithm to use, instead of having different methods.

Fix bug in setting "ok" value in GetGlobalXTCAVCalibration.

Tag: V00-00-12
2015-08-18 Christopher O'Grady
Change the GetGlobalXTCAVCalibration method to try all possible
names for each variable, since the previous method of using the
"strstrength" variable to decide how to read all the variables
didn't work for cxii0314 run 101.

Added parameters controllable by the user to the 'contourLabel' island splitting method

2015-08-11 Alvaro Sanchez-Gonzalez
-Modified how the islandSplitMethod is set for the shot to shot characterization, so the user can override the version set for the lasing off references.
-Added method ProcessedXTCAVImageROI returning the position of the ProcessedXTAV image after cropping within the full CCD.
-Parallelization of the lasing off generation process. The countour method for the island splitting method for the island splitting seems to improve things, but much computationally slower, so now we need parallel processing even for this. This has been done by Charles Olivier and Paul Micaelli.

- A fix from Alvaro for the calculation of a phase.

- Missed one of the calls to CalibrationPaths.

Tag: V00-00-08
2015-05-28 Christopher O'Grady
- Fix GenerateDarkBackground.py and GenerateLasingOffReference.py
  to pass env() instead of datasource to CalibrationPaths()

Tag: V00-00-07
2015-02-27 Christopher O'Grady
- Add interface ShotToShotCharacterization::SetEnv, which
  can be used like SetDataSource, but is usable from modules

Tag: V00-00-06
2015-02-26 Christopher O'Grady
- Support ebeamv7

- From Alvaro: Solved bug making the inter bunch delay function fail
  for vectors with an odd number of elements

Tag: V00-00-04
2015-02-20 Christopher O'Grady
- The latest changes from Alvaro:
- Island separation improved to better discard islands coming from noise, 
  and make it more robust in the determination of number of bunches.
- Improved method to extract the delay: Now it does a fit around the 
  maximum current
- New method to extract the delay between the bunches, documented in the 
  file.

- The latest changes from Alvaro:
- Included python-docstrings for the relevant classes/methods/functions 
- Done some cleanup from the repo of some old files that were not longer 
  in use.
- Added a few more retrieval functions to the ShotToShotCharacterization 
  class, all of them follow the format where the last argument is a flag 
  telling whether it was possible to retrieve the data
- Solved minor bugs.
